 *    *** Command types ***
 *
 * === Pinging ===
 * The ping command is sent by the host to check if the device is online.
 *
 *  HOST:   [cmd_ping]
 *  DEVICE: [cmd_response | cmd_ping] [1]
 *
 *
 * === Upgrade sessions ===
 * When the cmd_upgrade_start packet is received, the device prepares for
 * an upgrade session:
 *  1. The upgrade packet chunk size is determined based on the host's request
 *     and is written into the bootcom RAM in addition with the 16 bit crc of
 *     the new firmware. and the upgrade magick.
 *  2. The device restarts.
 *  3. The booloader detecs the upgrade magic in the bootcom RAM.
 *  4. The booloader sets the upgrade flag in the PAST.
 *  5. The bootloader initializes the UART, sends the cmd_upgrade_start ack and
 *     prepares for download.
 *  6. The bootloader receives the upgrade packets, writes the data to flash
 *     and acks each packet.
 *  7. When the last packet has been received, the bootloader clears the upgrade
 *     flag in the PAST and boots the app.
 *  8. The host pings the app to check the new firmware started.
 *
 *  HOST:        [cmd_upgrade_start] [chunk_size:16] [crc:16]
 *  DEVICE (BL): [cmd_response | cmd_upgrade_start] [<upgrade_status_t>] [<chunk_size:16>]  [<upgrade_reason_t:8>]
 *
 * The host will send packets of the agreed chunk size with the device 
 * acknowledging each packet once crc checked and written to flash. A packet
 * smaller than the chunk size or with zero payload indicates the end of the
 * upgrade session. The device will now return the outcome of the 32 bit crc
 * check of the new firmware and continue on step 7 above.
 *
 * The upgrade data packets have the following format with the payload size
 * expected to be equal to what was aggreed upon in the cmd_upgrade_start packet.
 *
 *  HOST:      [cmd_upgrade_data] [<payload>]+
 *  DEVICE BL: [cmd_response | cmd_upgrade_data] [<upgrade_status_t>]
