# The AAduino Zero

The AAduino Zero is the successor of the AAduino. This repo is currently being populated. Meanwhile, you can read all about it [here](https://johan.kanflo.com/the-aaduino-zero/).

If you cloned this repo prior to November 16th 2018, please note I changed the libopencm3 remote as STM32L0 now is mature on the official master. If building fails, reclone this repo from scratch.
